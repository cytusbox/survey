# Survey On FSA Learning

## Deep Specification Mining

### Contributions

1. We propose DSM (Deep Specification Miner), **a new specification mining algorithm** that utilizes test case generation, deep learning, clustering, and model selection strategy to infer FSA based specifications. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to use deep learning for mining specifications.
2. We evaluate the effectiveness of DSM on 11 different target library classes. Our results show that our approach outperforms the best baseline by a substantial margin in terms of average F-measure.
3. We propose a **technique that employs a FSA inferred by DSM to construct a more comprehensive sandbox** that considers execution context of sensitive API methods. Our evaluation shows that our proposed technique can outperform several baselines by a substantial margin in terms of either True Positive Rate or False Positive Rate.
