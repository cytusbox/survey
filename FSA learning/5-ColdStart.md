# Cold-Start and Interpretability: Turning Regular Expressions into Trainable Recurrent Neural Networks

[TOC]

## Contributions

1. In this paper, we propose finite-automaton recurrent neural networks (FA-RNN), a novel type of recurrent neural networks that is designed based on the computation process of weighted finite-state automata.
2. We apply FA-RNNs to the text classification task and compare them with neural network baselines as well as existing approaches of integrating REs and neural networks.

## Problem Set (input, output)

输入：离散迹
输出：分类

从正例迹和负例迹中学习WFA对迹进行分类。
